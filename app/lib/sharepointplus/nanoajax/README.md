NanoAjax
========

Since v3.13, SharepointPlus is not dependent on jQuery anymore.

However the library still needs **something to handle the Ajax requests**. If you're still using jQuery in your project, then it's fine and make sure to call it before SharepointPlus.

But, if you don't use jQuery, then **you have to include [nanoajax](https://github.com/Aymkdn/SharepointPlus/blob/v3.13-development/nanoajax/nanoajax.min.js)**, a 1K library that is available at https://github.com/yanatan16/nanoajax
