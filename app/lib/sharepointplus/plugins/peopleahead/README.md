People Ahead
============

**For Sharepoint 2013**

You might want to use the SP2013 native People Picker... To do it, [refer to this Gist](https://gist.github.com/Aymkdn/5925efc9f4fecccc40612c6a5db7efc9).

**Otherwise**

This plugin permits to change a simple `<input type="text">` to a text field connected to the Sharepoint address book where you can type an user name and select him/her from a list.

**Attention** : jQuery is required for this plugin.

Example
-------

You have to include jQuery, SharepointPlus and the plugin. Add these lines to your `<head>` (make sure you use the last version of SharepointPlus):
````html
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="sharepointplus-3.0.5.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="peopleahead/sp-plugin.peopleahead.js"></script>
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="peopleahead/sp-plugin.peopleahead.css">
````

Include also a text box in your code:
````html
<input type="text" id="people-picker">
````

Now, after this tag, you can add the below JavaScript:

````html
<script type="text/javascript">
$SP().plugin('peopleahead',{
  selector:'#people-picker',
  onselect:function() {
    var $this=$(this);
    alert($this.data('name')+" ("+$this.data('email')+") has been selected");
  }
});
</script>
````


Your simple input text box becomes:

![alt text](https://raw.github.com/Aymkdn/SharepointPlus/master/plugins/peopleahead/example/_1.png "Textbox")

And if you start typing the name of someone in your company:

![alt text](https://raw.github.com/Aymkdn/SharepointPlus/master/plugins/peopleahead/example/_2.png "Textbox")

    limit:10,
    loading:'http://www.mysite.com/images/loading.gif',
    noresult:'Nothing found... Sorry.',
    onselect:function() {
      // 'this' is the A element that we click which contains in data attribute the "userid", "email", "name", "login" and "title"
      var $this=$(this);
      alert('You have selected '+$this.data('name')+' and the related email is '+$this.data('email'));
      // and you can get even more info using $SP().people().
      // for example if you want to get the WorkPhone you'll do:
      $SP().people($this.data('login'), function(p) {
        alert("The email for "+$this.data('name')+" is "+p["WorkPhone"])
      })
    }
  })
````
