SharepointPlus Unit Tests
=========================

The [unit test page](qunit-test.html) **will automatically create a test environment for you**, using [SPServices](http://spservices.codeplex.com/). Just point your browser to `qunit-test.html`.

Be aware that you need to have a Full Control on the website because the test environment will create:
  1. A group called `SharepointPlus`
  2. Two Sharepoint lists called `SharepointPlus` and `SharepointPlusLookup`
  3. A document library called `SharepointPlusLibrary`

Once all the tests passed, you can click on the `delete the test environment` button at the top of the page.
